# The Architect's Playbook - Pillar 1: MCP Financial Analyst

**Part of The Architect's Playbook Series** - Building Production-Grade AI Systems

This is **Pillar 1: Standardization**, where we master the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by building a production-grade AI Financial Analyst. This isn't another chatbot demo - it's a complete system demonstrating how MCP revolutionizes AI-to-service communication.

## üèóÔ∏è The Architect's Playbook Series

**Five Pillars of Modern AI Architecture:**
- **Pillar 1: Standardization (MCP)** ‚Üê You are here
- Pillar 2: Autonomy (Computer Vision Agents)
- Pillar 3: Collaboration (Multi-Agent Systems)  
- Pillar 4: Reliability (Production Monitoring)
- Pillar 5: Framework Maturity (Professional SDKs)

## ‚ú® What You'll Build

A complete AI Financial Analyst featuring:

- **Production MCP Integration:** Real JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol communication
- **Intelligent Fallback Systems:** Professional error handling and recovery
- **Live Market Data:** Real-time stock prices and portfolio analysis
- **Advanced Analytics:** Risk assessment, diversification scoring, performance metrics
- **Professional UI:** Streamlit dashboard with real-time monitoring
- **Full Observability:** Connection status, response times, error tracking

## üåê Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This project showcases MCP - the "Wi-Fi for AI" - a universal standard for AI-to-service communication:

- **Standardized:** JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol adopted by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic
- **Secure:** Built-in authentication and permission management
- **Scalable:** Plug-and-play architecture for any service
- **Production-Ready:** Intelligent error handling and fallback systems

**MCP Servers Demonstrated:**
- **Market Data:** Professional stock market integration with fallback
- **Stripe Payments:** Local MCP server for payment analytics
- **System Diagnostics:** Real-time MCP health monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) with JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Agent Framework:** LangGraph & LangChain for orchestration
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o for reasoning and analysis
- **Web UI:** Streamlit with real-time monitoring
- **Language:** Python 3.9+

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+ (for Stripe MCP server)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/architects-playbook-pillar1.git
cd architects-playbook-pillar1

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

### Run the Application

```bash
# Start the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

**Optional:** For live Stripe data, start the MCP server:
```bash
./setup_stripe_mcp.sh
```

## üéØ Key Learning Outcomes

By building this project, you'll master:

1. **MCP Protocol Fundamentals:** JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation patterns
2. **Production Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and recovery systems  
3. **AI Agent Orchestration:** Using LangGraph for complex workflows
4. **Real-time Monitoring:** Building observability into AI systems
5. **Professional UI Design:** Creating production-grade interfaces

## üìä Try These Queries

**Market Data:**
- "What's the current NIFTY 50 price and performance?"
- "Show me RELIANCE and TCS stock analysis"

**Portfolio Analysis:**
- "Analyze portfolio: 10 RELIANCE, 5 TCS, 20 HDFC, 15 INFY"
- "Calculate portfolio risk and diversification score"

**System Diagnostics:**
- "Check MCP system status and server health"
- "Show connection pool metrics and performance"

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter MCP connection issues, see the detailed [MCP Troubleshooting Guide](MCP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Common issues:
- **MCP Authentication Errors:** Expected behavior - demonstrates professional fallback
- **Connection Timeouts:** System gracefully handles and provides demo data
- **Import Errors:** Ensure Python 3.9+ and all dependencies installed
